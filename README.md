Improvised Course Registration is majorly a project that can help students in colleges to make the most out of their college degree
     <br />
Here's why:
     <br />
* Check for all the prerequisites of a course before registering for it <br />
* Industry-relevant tracks having courses offered by the college that students can follow according to their interests <br />
* Completely transparent Course details so that students have all information related to all the courses beforehand like Labs, Assignments, tests ,teachers etc  <br />
* Removes Branch Barriers ,  by helping recruiters shortlist the students on the basis of courses that they have done instead of their branch branch <br />
